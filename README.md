## Introduction
Parknav has developed an app that shows the likelihood of on-street parking is available at a given time. The task assigned to USFâ€™s MSAN students was along similar lines - can we build a predictive model using data on parking meters and the limited number of manually labeled observations? 

The report describes the data exploration and modeling conducted on the problem of availability of on-street parking in San Francisco. It describes how we cleaned the data provided by Parknav, used external information to augment our understanding of the data, merged two separate datasets, and generated several features to help our models learn better. We also provide a description of the machine learning approaches adopted to predict whether a particular street segment has parking spots available.
